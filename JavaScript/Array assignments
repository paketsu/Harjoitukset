    /* 2. Make a program that draws 7 digits for Lotto numbers. 
    You have to make sure that same number isnâ€™t there many times. 
    You can use array that has 40 pieces of zeros. 
    When you get a random number that is the index of the array and you make the value inside zero to one, 
    but if it already was one you draw a new random number. 
    At the end you print out the indexes that has one as a value inside.
    Go and check how you can get random number in JavaScript. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-math-random-function/ */
